## What are AI Skills?

Essentially, AI Skills are specialized components within Fabric that allow users to query and interact with their data using natural language. Imagine it as a conversational interface built directly into your data environment. By defining AI Skills, you empower users to ask questions like "What were the top-selling products in Q3?" or "Show me the sales trends for this region" in plain English.

## How AI Skills Work?

1. Data Integration: You select the specific tables or data sources within Fabric that you want to make accessible through the AI Skill.
2. Text-to-SQL Translation: The AI Skill leverages powerful natural language processing capabilities to understand user queries and translate them into appropriate SQL statements.
3. Data Retrieval and Process: The system executes the generated SQL, retrieves the relevant data, and provide it to the Large Language Model (LLM) to construct the response.

## Key Benefits of AI Skills

- Democratized Data Access: AI Skills break down barriers to data access, making it easier for business users with limited technical expertise to explore and analyze data.
- Increased Productivity: By eliminating the need for complex SQL queries, users can quickly obtain the information they need, significantly improving their productivity.
- Enhanced Data Discovery: AI Skills encourage users to ask more exploratory questions, leading to new insights and a deeper understanding of their data.
- Improved Data Governance: By centralizing data access through a controlled interface, organizations can better manage data usage and ensure data security.

## The Future of AI Skills in Fabric

The introduction of AI Skills marks a significant step towards a more intuitive and user-centric data experience. As the technology evolves, we can expect even more sophisticated capabilities, such as:

- More complex query handling: The ability to handle more nuanced and sophisticated natural language queries, including multi-step analyses and conditional statements.
- Personalized experiences: Tailored AI Skills that adapt to individual user preferences and provide personalized insights.
- Integration with other tools: Seamless integration with other tools and platforms within the Microsoft ecosystem, such as Power BI and Power Apps.

## Will it replace jobs?

The direction AI Skills in Fabric and other Text to SQL execution tools can replace a wide range of workloads by data teams. While it may not replace the reporting dashboards, it will facilitate the data consumer's overall self service experience by providing immediate response to user request and help improve decision making process.

As these tools replace some analytical skillset, it does create new frontier in skills design, orchestration fine tuning and grounding and testing.

## Conclusion

AI Skills in Fabric represent a powerful new paradigm for data interaction. By empowering users to interact with their data through natural language, this innovative feature unlocks new levels of accessibility, productivity, and insight. As this technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more transformative applications that redefine how businesses leverage their data assets.
