# Report Development in Fabric Direct Lake VS Import in Power BI

Dave has been using Power BI for a long time, and he is now starting to experiment with Fabric. He is particularly interested in comparing the two approaches for direct query development.

He starts by explaining that Fabric is a new platform that offers a number of advantages over Power BI. These advantages include the ability to store unstructured data, the ability to use Python and other languages for data transformation, and the ability to integrate with Azure Synapse Analytics.

Next, he compares the two approaches for direct query development. He finds that the Power BI approach is simpler to use, but the Fabric approach offers more flexibility. For example, Fabric allows you to create custom dataflows, which can be used to preprocess data before it is queried.

Finally, he discusses the challenges of using Fabric for report development. He finds that the platform can be complex to learn, and that it can be difficult to get started with. However, he believes that the benefits of using Fabric outweigh the challenges.
