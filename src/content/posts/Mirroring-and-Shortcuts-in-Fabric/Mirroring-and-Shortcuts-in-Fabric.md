# Mirroring and Shortcuts in Fabric

Fabric is a cloud-based data integration and analytics platform that allows you to connect to and transform data from a variety of sources, including relational databases, data warehouses, and data lakes. In this blog post, we will discuss two new features in Fabric that make it easier to mirror data from Azure SQL and Cosmos DB databases, and to create shortcuts to data in Fabric.

## Mirroring Data from Azure SQL and Cosmos DB

One of the new features in Fabric is the ability to mirror data from Azure SQL and Cosmos DB databases. This means that you can create a replica of your data in Fabric, and then use Fabric to transform and analyze the data. This is a great way to offload the burden of data processing from your transactional databases, and to make it easier to access and analyze your data.

To mirror data from Azure SQL or Cosmos DB, you simply need to create a new mirror in Fabric. You can then specify the source database, the target data warehouse or lake house, and the schema that you want to mirror. Fabric will then create a replica of the data in the target location.

## Creating Shortcuts to Data in Fabric

Another exciting feature in Fabric is the ability to create shortcuts to the mirrored database. This allows you to quickly and easily access data that you have previously transformed or analysed. You can also create the shortcuts in Lakehouse.

To create a shortcut, simply right-click on the Lakehouse that you want to create a shortcut for, and select "Create Shortcut". You can then give the shortcut a name. Once you have created a shortcut, you can double-click on it to view available options.

## Benefits of Mirroring and Shortcuts

There are several benefits to using mirroring and shortcuts in Fabric. First, it can help you to offload the burden of data processing from your transactional databases. Second, it can make it easier to access and analyse your data. Third, it can help you to consolidate data activities into a single workspace.

## Conclusion

Mirroring and shortcuts are two new features in Fabric that simplified your end to end data journey. If you are looking for a way to simplify your data pipelines and improve the performance of your data analysis for transactional database in Azure SQL, then you should consider using these features.
