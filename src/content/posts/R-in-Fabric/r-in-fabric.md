## Why R?
* **Deep Industry Focus**: R has a rich history and a strong community dedicated to specific industries, offering deep insights and specialized tools.
* **Statistical Powerhouse**: It's renowned for its statistical capabilities, making it a preferred choice for data scientists and analysts.
* **Open-Source and Free**: Like Python, R is open-source, ensuring accessibility and flexibility.

## R in Fabric

The integration of R with Fabric opens up a world of possibilities for data scientists:

* **Spark R Runtime**: Fabric's Spark R runtime allows you to leverage the power of R directly within your notebooks.
* **Seamless Integration**: Easily incorporate R code into your data pipelines, alongside Python and other languages.
* **Leveraging Fabric's Ecosystem**: Benefit from Fabric's robust ecosystem, including data ingestion, transformation, visualization, and machine learning capabilities.

## Conclusion
Fabric is expanding more capabilities each week. While this is amazing from a platform perspective, the amount of decisions on simple tasks may also be overwhelming. It is important to understand the underlying purpose of the organisation and narrow it down to a smaller toolset and avoid high maintenance costs.
