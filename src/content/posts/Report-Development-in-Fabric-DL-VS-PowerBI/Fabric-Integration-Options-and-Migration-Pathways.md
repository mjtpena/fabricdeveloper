## Integration Options
There are a number of different ways to integrate with Fabric. Some of the most common options include:

* **Using the Fabric API**: The Fabric API allows you to interact with Fabric programmatically. This is a good option for developers who want to build custom integrations.
* **Using Fabric Data Factory**: Fabric Data Factory is a cloud-based data integration service that allows you to create and schedule data pipelines. This is a good option for organizations that need to automate their data integration processes.
* **Using Fabric Notebooks**: Fabric Notebooks are interactive development environments that allow you to explore and analyze data. This is a good option for data scientists and analysts who want to experiment with different data processing techniques.
* **Using Fabric Power BI**: Fabric Power BI is a cloud-based business intelligence service that allows you to create interactive reports and dashboards. This is a good option for organizations that need to visualize and share their data.

## Migration Pathways
If you are already using another data platform, there are a number of different migration pathways available. Some of the most common options include:

* **Migrating your entire data platform to Fabric**: This is the most comprehensive option, but it can also be the most time-consuming and expensive.
* **Migrating specific workloads to Fabric**: This is a good option if you only need to migrate certain workloads to Fabric.
* **Using Fabric to supplement your existing data platform**: This is a good option if you want to use Fabric to add new capabilities to your existing data platform.
