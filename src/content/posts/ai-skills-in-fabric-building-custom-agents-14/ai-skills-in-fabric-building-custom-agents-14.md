# AI Skills in Fabric: Building Custom Agents

AI capabilities in Fabric, powered by Copilot and Azure AI services, transform how analysts interact with data and accelerate insights.

## Copilot Capabilities

Natural language queries in Power BI. Code suggestions in notebooks. SQL generation from natural language. Report generation. Trend identification and anomaly detection.

## Use Cases

1. Ad-hoc analysis: 'Show me top customers by revenue'. 2. Report creation: Copilot suggests visualizations. 3. Debugging: 'Why is this query slow?'. 4. Documentation: Generate summaries.

## AI Skills

Expose Fabric data to external apps via natural language. Chatbots query your data without SQL knowledge. Custom AI agents for business domains. Integration with Azure AI Foundry.

## Limitations and Considerations

Copilot works best with clear data and semantics. May hallucinate if data is ambiguous. Requires good data governance. Security: Copilot respects row-level security.

## Azure AI Integration

Connect to Azure Cognitive Services. Document intelligence, language understanding, computer vision. Build hybrid AI solutions combining Fabric + Azure AI.

## Future Roadmap

More sophisticated AI reasoning. Predictive analytics automation. Autonomous agents for data quality. Integration with more Azure AI services.
