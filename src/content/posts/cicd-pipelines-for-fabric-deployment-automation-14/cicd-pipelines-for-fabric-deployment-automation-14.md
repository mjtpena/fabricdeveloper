# CI/CD Pipelines for Fabric: Deployment Automation

DevOps practices in Fabric enable rapid, reliable deployments. Git integration, CI/CD pipelines, and REST APIs automate the development lifecycle.

## Git Integration

Connect Fabric workspace to GitHub/Azure DevOps. Version control all Fabric items (pipelines, notebooks, reports). Create branches for features. Merge via pull requests.

## CI/CD Pipelines

Deploy changes across dev → staging → production. Automate testing and validation. Roll back on failures. Use GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines for orchestration.

## REST APIs

Automate Fabric administration. Deploy items programmatically. Trigger pipelines. Scale capacity. Monitor usage. REST APIs enable infrastructure-as-code.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Use Terraform for Fabric deployment. Define workspaces, capacities, item permissions in code. Replicate environments reliably. Version control infrastructure.

## Deployment Strategies

Blue-green deployment: Run two production environments, switch traffic. Canary deployment: Deploy to small user subset first. Feature flags: Enable features gradually.

## Monitoring and Observability

Log all deployments. Track item changes via audit logs. Monitor performance before/after deployments. Alert on failures. Maintain runbooks for incident response.
