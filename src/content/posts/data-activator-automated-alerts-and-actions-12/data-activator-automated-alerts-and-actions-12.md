# Data Activator: Automated Alerts and Actions

Real-time analytics enable instant insights from streaming data. Ingest events, analyze with KQL, visualize in real-time dashboards, and automate actions.

## Eventstreams Architecture

Capture events from Azure Event Hubs, Kafka, custom applications. Buffer events temporarily. Route to multiple destinations (KQL, Lakehouse, external services).

## KQL Database Fundamentals

Optimized for time-series data. Ingests millions of events/second. Queries analyze multi-year data in milliseconds. Supports complex analytics including machine learning functions.

## KQL Query Language

Similar to SQL but optimized for time-series. Common operators: where (filter), summarize (aggregation), project (select columns), join, union. Powerful for fast exploratory analysis.

## Real-Time Dashboards

Connect KQL queries to dashboards. Auto-refresh at 1-second intervals. Pin visualizations for monitoring. Use for operational dashboards and real-time metrics.

## Data Activator (Automation)

Define conditions on KQL data. Trigger Power Automate flows or web hooks when conditions met. Common use: Alert on anomalies, route high-priority events, update external systems.

## Performance Considerations

Ingestion: Optimize event schema. Queries: Use time filters and aggregations. Storage: Data retention policy balances cost and analysis window.
