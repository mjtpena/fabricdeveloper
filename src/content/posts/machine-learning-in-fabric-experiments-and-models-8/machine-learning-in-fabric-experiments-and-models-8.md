# Machine Learning in Fabric: Experiments and Models

Machine learning in Fabric integrates with Azure AI services, MLflow, and AutoML. Build, train, and deploy models at scale.

## ML Workflow in Fabric

1. Prepare data in Lakehouse. 2. Explore via notebooks. 3. Train models using scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM. 4. Track experiments in MLflow. 5. Deploy models for inference. 6. Monitor performance.

## MLflow Integration

Log parameters, metrics, and models. Compare experiments side-by-side. Track model versions. Manage model registry for deployment. MLflow is the industry standard for ML operations.

## AutoML Capabilities

Fabric AutoML automatically tests multiple algorithms. Returns best model with feature importance. Saves time for baseline models. Useful for rapid prototyping.

## Feature Engineering

Create features in PySpark notebooks. Use time-series features (lags, rolling statistics). Scale features before training. Validate features improve model performance.

## Model Deployment

Export trained models. Deploy to endpoints for real-time inference. Batch scoring via notebooks or pipelines. Version models for rollback capability.

## Common ML Patterns in Fabric

Pattern 1: Real-time churn prediction. Pattern 2: Demand forecasting. Pattern 3: Anomaly detection. Pattern 4: Recommendation engines.
