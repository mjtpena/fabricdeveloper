# Microsoft Fabric Announced at Build 2023: A New Era of Unified Analytics

Microsoft Fabric represents a fundamental shift in how organizations approach data analytics. Announced at Build 2023, Fabric is an all-in-one cloud-native analytics platform that brings together:

- **Data Engineering** with Apache Spark
- **Data Integration** through modernized Data Factory
- **Data Warehousing** with Synapse SQL
- **Real-Time Analytics** with event streaming
- **Data Science** with ML capabilities
- **Business Intelligence** with Power BI

The platform's core innovation is OneLake - a single, unified data repository that eliminates data silos. Unlike traditional architectures where data teams maintain separate data lakes, data warehouses, and BI systems, Fabric provides one coherent data platform.

**Why This Matters:** Organizations previously needed 4-5 different tools to achieve what Fabric does. This consolidation reduces complexity, cost, and time-to-insight. The per-capacity pricing model also shifts from per-user to per-compute, aligning costs with actual usage.

**Key Technical Innovations:**
- OneLake: Single repository accessible to all workloads via Spark, SQL, and BI
- Shortcuts: Virtual references to external data (ADLS, S3, GCS) without copying
- Lakehouses: Combines lake scalability with warehouse structure
- Unified Governance: One place to manage security, compliance, and metadata

**Availability:** Public preview launched immediately at Build 2023, with general availability planned for later in the year.
