# Semantic Models in Fabric: Design Patterns

Power BI in Fabric delivers cutting-edge analytics and visualization. Direct Lake mode, semantic models, and Copilot transform how organizations analyze data.

## Semantic Models in Fabric

Define business logic once in semantic model. Share across multiple reports. Business users don't need to understand underlying data structures. Enforce consistent calculations.

## Direct Lake Mode

Query data directly from OneLake without import. Eliminates ETL delay. Real-time analytics on fresh data. Reduces storage consumption. Automatic aggregations for performance.

## Report Design Best Practices

1. Clear visual hierarchy. 2. Consistent color schemes. 3. Appropriate visualization types. 4. Drill-down capabilities. 5. Mobile responsiveness.

## Copilot in Power BI

Natural language queries: 'Show me sales by region'. Auto-generated visuals. Smart narratives explaining insights. Q&A from reports. Reduces time to insight.

## Row-Level Security (RLS)

Control what data each user sees. Implemented in semantic model. Transparent to users. Common pattern: Sales reps see only their region's data.

## Performance Tuning

Monitor refresh times. Optimize aggregations. Use query folding in imports. Consider Direct Lake for real-time scenarios. Benchmark across models.
