# Workspace Administration: Roles and Permissions

Effective Fabric administration ensures performance, security, and cost optimization. Master capacity management, user governance, and monitoring.

## Capacity Planning

Fabric pricing is based on capacity (compute units purchased per month). F2 starts at 360 CUs/month. Monitor actual usage via Capacity Metrics app. Scale capacity based on peak demand.

## Workspace Organization

Workspaces are containers for Fabric items. Organize by business unit, project, or team. Assign workspace admins for delegated management. Use Git integration for version control.

## User Roles and Permissions

Admin: Full access. Member: Create, edit items. Contributor: Create items (limited). Viewer: Read-only access. Assign minimum required permissions (principle of least privilege).

## Monitoring and Diagnostics

Capacity Metrics app: CPU, memory, throttling. Operations app: Item operations and performance. Set alerts for anomalies. Investigate slow queries via diagnostics.

## Cost Optimization

Right-size capacity to actual usage. Use pause-resume to stop billing during off-hours. Dedup data via shortcuts. Archive old data. Review monthly usage reports.

## Governance and Compliance

Enable audit logging. Classify data with sensitivity labels. Enforce DLP policies. Control external sharing. Regular access reviews.
